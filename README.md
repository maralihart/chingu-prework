# chingu-prework
For a program called Chingu, I am making an copy of a template using "vanilla" HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by <a href="https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer">Conquer</a>, I created a template from scratch as a requirement of this project was using limited libraries -- I ended up using JQuery only.

If you'd like to contribute and help improve this template, I'd welcome any help. 
Bugs:
- When clicking on the nav bar, content is covered. Current solution: added padding, but I want something more efficient
